You should use the map editor to set the terrain values as it would be very difficult to do it by hand.

Basic terrain masks are listed in tables Common Terrain Masks and Rare Terrain Masks. Note that the terrain masks used in editing maps are NOT the same as the terrain masks in the Modding Manual that are used for modding magic sites. All terrain masks listed in the Common Terrain Masks table can be set from the map editor.

The terrain masks in the Rare Terrain Masks table cannot be added from the map editor and you must add them to the base terrain mask calculated by the map editor. The advanced terrain masks make it more likely that when a magic site is placed in the province, it will be of that specific type.
