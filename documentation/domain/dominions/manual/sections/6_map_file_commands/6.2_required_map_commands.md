6.2 Required Map Commands
-------------------------

These map commands must exist in every map file or the map will not work.

**#dom2title <text>**  
The title of the map. This must be the first command for every map. The reason why this command is named #dom2title instead of #dom5title is because the map command syntax used here was first introduced in Dominions 2: The Ascension Wars and much of it has been kept the same since then.

**#imagefile <filename>**  
The image file of the map in TGA, RGB or PNG format. The file should be at least 256x256 pixels large and saved in 24 or 32 bit color formats. PNG files cannot be interlaced. A suitable size for a map might be about 1600x1200 pixels. For more detailed information related to the image file, see Chapter 5: The Map Image File.

**#mapsize <width> <height>**  
Lets Dominions 5 know the size of the map in pixels.
