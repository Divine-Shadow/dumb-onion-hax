7 Random Map Generator
======================

Dominions 5 comes with a powerful random map generator (RMG for short). The random map generator can be run from the Game Tools menu and the preferences set as to size of map, number of provinces, ratio of each terrain type and various wrap options (east-west, north-south or full wraparound).

The RMG creates beautifully rendered maps that are ready to play right out of the box. However, it is worth using the map editor to check the randomly generated map for province connections that can be improved, because the random generation procedure does not always see things like a human player would.

Using command line switches, it is possible to specify some more options for the RMG than from the Game Tools menu. The RMG can be used to create maps with borders set to zero pixels in width. Some quick work with a paint program makes it possible to create a completely custom map with hand selected province locations and hand drawn borders without needing to do all the tedious map drawing completely from scratch if that is your preference.

Further, there is a command line switch called _–mapnospr_ which creates a completely blank map template without any graphics drawn on it. Only the landmass and seas are drawn and provinces are assigned as normal. Such a blank canvas can then be painted with the map graphics of the cartographer’s choice followed by province placement and drawing borders for a unique map.
