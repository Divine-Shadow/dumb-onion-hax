3 Data Directories
==================

The data directory for storing saved games, mods and maps is different depending on the operating system.

*   Linux: ~/.dominions5
*   Mac: ~/.dominions5
*   Windows: %APPDATA%5

The easiest way to locate the data directories in Dominions 5 is by opening Game Tools from the Main Menu and using the Open User Data Directory function. The operating system will open the user data directory in a separate file manager window.
