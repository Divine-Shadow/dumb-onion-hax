9 Dominions 4 Maps
==================

Dominions 4 maps are compatible with Dominions 5 with certain reservations. Basic terrain masks and other map commands are the same, so those do not present a problem and unscripted Dominions 4 maps can be used without modification.

The main differences is that Dominions 4 maps do not contain information about the areas covered by each province. This information should be added by using the map editor. Maps can be used without this information, but the dominion overlay will often look bad.

Another major difference is that Dominions 4 maps do not have a winter variant. You can play without a winter map, but it will be difficult to know where movement is hindered and where rivers are frozen.
