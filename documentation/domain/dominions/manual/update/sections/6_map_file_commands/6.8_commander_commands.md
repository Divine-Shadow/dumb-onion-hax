6.8 Commander Commands
--------------------
These commands are used to set specific monsters in the
active province and manipulate those monsters to modify
them from the base monster type to create thematic
provinces and special heroes. They must be used after the
#land or #setland commands, because they require an active
province. Whenever commanders and units are placed on a
map, the type can be set using either the monster number or
the monster name in quote marks. If the commander or unit
to be added is a new monster defined in a mod, then monster
number cannot be used and the name must be used instead.
