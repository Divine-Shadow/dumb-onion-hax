6.11 Terrain Graphics
----------------------
In order for Dominions to be able to change terrains of
provinces extra images are needed to show what those
terrains look like. If you have a map called mymap.map the
map images should be named like this:
mymap.tga Default look and water provinces
mymap_winter.tga Default winter look
mymap_forest.tga Look for forests
mymap_waste.tga Look for wastes
mymap_farm.tga Look for farms
mymap_swamp.tga Look for swamps
mymap_highland.tga Look for hioghlands
mymap_plain.tga Look for plains
mymap_kelp.tga Look for kelp forests
mymap_water.tga Look for drowned land provinces
All files (except the 2 first ones) can have a "w" added (e.g.
mymap_forestw.tga) to set the winter look for a specific
terrain. Note that if mymap.tga only contains plain provinces
there won't be any need for the mymap_plain.tga file.
It is not necessary to have all the terrain looks. The default
look will be used when no specific one is available.
If you don't provide specific terrain files you might want to set
the default terrain in the mpa editor. That way Dominions will
not randomize the start terrain of the provinces (except for
home provinces that will always be changed to a nations
preferred one).
If you have multiple planes the plane2 part should go first, e.g.
mymap_plane2_waste.tga.
