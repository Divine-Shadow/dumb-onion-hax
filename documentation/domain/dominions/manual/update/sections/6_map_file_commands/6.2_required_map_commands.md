6.2 Required Map Commands
------------------------

These map commands must exist in every map file or the map will not work.

* `#dom2title <text>` – The title of the map. This must be the first command for every map. The reason why this command is named `#dom2title` instead of `#dom6title` is because the map command syntax used here was first introduced in Dominions 2: The Ascension Wars and much of it has been kept the same since then.
* `#imagefile <filename>` – The image file of the map in TGA format. The file should be at least 256x256 pixels large and saved in 24 or 32 bit color formats. A suitable size for a map might be about 1600x1200 pixels. For more detailed information related to the image file, see Chapter "The Map Image File".
* `#mapsize <width> <height>` – Lets Dominions know the size of the map in pixels.
