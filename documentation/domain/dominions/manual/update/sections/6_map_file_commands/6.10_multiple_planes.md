6.10 Multiple Planes
-------------------
You can have a map with multiple planes if you want. Each
plane needs its own .map file and .tga file(s). The extra planes
must end with e.g. ..._plane2.map or ..._plane2.tga if it is plane
2 (the first extra plane).
When you start the map editor you should always load the
first plane, the rest if any will be loaded and saved
automatically.
There can be up to 8 planes in a map (7 extra ones).
