6.7 Province Commands
-------------------
These commands are used to manipulate specific provinces in
order to set different features manually instead of being
randomly assigned during game setup. Unless otherwise
specified, they only affect the active province.
#land <province nbr>
Sets the active province and kills everyone in it. All the following
commands will only affect the active province. Use this
command if you want to activate a province in order to replace
its random inhabitants with the monsters of your choice.
#setland <province nbr>
Sets the active province. All the following commands will only
affect the active province.
#poptype <poptype nbr>
Sets the population type of the active province. This determines
which troops may be recruited in the province. Poptype
numbers can be found in the "poptypes" table.
This command will override the poptype that was randomly
assigned to the province during game creation, but it will NOT
change the independent defenders, which will be of the
poptype this command overwrote.
Example: if the randomly determined poptype during game
creation was 42 (Jade Amazons) and the poptype has been set
to 25 (Barbarians) by this map command, the independent
defenders will still be Jade Amazons. You just won't be able to
recruit them.

#owner <nation nbr>
Changes the ownership of the active province. Nation nbr
indicates the new owner.
#killfeatures
Removes all magic sites from the active province.
#feature "<site name>" \| <site nbr>
Puts a specific magic site in the active province. Adding unique
sites to a map using this command will NOT prevent those sites
from appearing randomly, because the map file is only applied to
the game map after game setup has done random determination
of sites for each province.
#knownfeature "<site name>" \| <site nbr>
Puts a specific magic site in the active province. This site is
already found at the start of the game, regardless of its ordinary
path level. Using this command prevents special features of the
site that depend on its discovery from activating.
#fort <fort nbr>
Puts a specific fort in the active province. Fort numbers can be
found in the "Fortifications" table. Will replace a nation's default
fort if used on a capital location.

be a power of two. 1024*1024 is a good size.
#batmap "<battlemap.d3m>
Sets the battleground that fights take place in for the current
province. You can use the special name ' empty ' for no
battleground, useful for battles in space perhaps. This will affect
fights both outside and inside castles.
