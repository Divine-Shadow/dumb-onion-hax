7 Random Map Generator
======================

Dominions 6 comes with a powerful random map generator (RMG for short). The random map generator can be run from the Game Tools menu and the preferences set as to size of map, number of provinces, ratio of each terrain type and various wrap options (east-west, north-south or full wraparound).

The RMG creates beautifully rendered maps that are ready to play right out of the box. However, it is worth using the map editor to check the randomly generated map for province connections that can be improved, because the random generation procedure does not always see things like a human player would.

### Random Map Files

The RMG creates d6m files instead of the usual tga files that are used to create hand drawn maps. The d6m files are unique to Dominions 6 and contain the geography needed to render the map with arbitrary terrains. The details of this file can be found in the separate "fileformat_d6m" document. It is usually not necessary to know how this file is constructed, but automated map generators might find it useful.
