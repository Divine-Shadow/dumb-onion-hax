9 Dominions 5 Maps
==================

Dominions 5 maps are compatible with Dominions 6 with certain reservations.

Basic terrain masks and other map commands are mostly the same, but the border mountain number has changed so maps that have those will need some modification (most easily done using the map editor). Start locations also had their number changed and have to be updated (can be done using the map editor).

The main difference is that Dominions 5 maps do not contain images for different terrains. This makes it impossible for Dominions 6 to show the correct graphics for a province that has changed its terrain or maybe sunk into the water.

Scripted Dominions 5 maps will probably not work in Dominions 6 as numbers for nations have changed as well as some monster names.
