3 Data Directories
==================

| OS      | Path                   |
|---------|------------------------|
| Linux   | ~/.dominions6          |
| Mac     | ~/.dominions6          |
| Windows | %APPDATA%\\dominions6 |

The easiest way to locate the data directories in Dominions 6 is by opening Game Tools from the Main Menu and using the Open User Data Directory function. The operating system will open the user data directory in a separate file manager window.

### Legal File Names

It is important that the file name doesn't contain any special characters or spaces. Valid characters are a-z, A-Z, underscore and of course a dot for the extension. Illegal file names might work for single player, but will not work in multiplayer.
