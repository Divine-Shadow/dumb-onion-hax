1 Introduction
==============

This document is a guide to making maps for Dominions 5. It covers the basics of how to create a map and how to use the functionality built into Dominions to customize and develop them beyond the basics provided by the graphical interface of the map editor. This manual should give the reader all the tools necessary to create and modify maps, but it does not provide an extensive tutorial on how to create a map from scratch. Image processing guides are beyond the scope of this document. The chapter about the random map generator provides only the basics. The full potential of the RMG is beyond the scope of this manual.
