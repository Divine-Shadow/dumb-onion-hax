# Map State Model Migration Plan

Migration to a directive stream `MapState` ensures that only documented `MapDirective` lines drive state while all other lines roundâ€‘trip verbatim. See [Migration Progress](map_state_model_migration_progress.md) for current status.

## Directive Inventory & Authority Map
| Directive | Authority | Emission rule | Status (evidence) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `#mapsize` | State-owned | state-rendered | `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapDirective.scala`, `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapState.scala` |
| `#dom2title`, `#description` | State-owned | state-rendered | `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapDirective.scala` |
| `#wraparound`, `#hwraparound`, `#vwraparound`, `#nowraparound` | State-owned | state-rendered | `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapDirective.scala` |
| `#allowedplayer`, `#specstart` | State-owned | state-rendered | `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapDirective.scala` |
| `#terrain`, `#gate`, `#neighbour`, `#neighbourspec` | State-owned | state-rendered | `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapDirective.scala` |
| `#province` | State-owned | state-rendered | `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapDirective.scala` |
| `#pb` | Pass-through + Derived-input | verbatim; source for derived province locations | `MapDirective.Pb` absent in `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapDirective.scala` |
| `#imagefile`, `#winterimagefile`, `#domversion`, `#nodeepcaves`, `#nodeepchoice`, `#mapnohide`, `#maptextcol`, `#mapdomcol`, `#landname` | Pass-through | verbatim | `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapDirective.scala` |
| comment lines (`--`) | Pass-through | verbatim | `MapDirective.Comment` absent in `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapDirective.scala` |
| Derived province locations (from `#pb` runs via `ProvinceLocationService`) | Derived-input | state-rendered | `model/src/main/scala/model/map/ProvinceLocationService.scala` |

## Two-Pass Behavior
Pass 1 consumes the full `MapDirective` stream to build `MapState`, retaining pass-through directives. Pass 2 re-emits pass-through directives verbatim and renders state-owned directives from `MapState` in canonical order; state-rendered output wins on conflicts. Verification relies on pass-through round-trips, ordered state sections, and feature-flagged end-to-end runs.

### Ordering & Merge Rules
- **State-rendered families:** map metadata (`#mapsize`, `#dom2title`, `#description`), wrap settings (`#wraparound`, `#hwraparound`, `#vwraparound`, `#nowraparound`), player constraints (`#allowedplayer`, `#specstart`), and province blocks (`#province`, `#terrain`, `#gate`, `#neighbour`, `#neighbourspec`, `#landname`).
- **Merge policy:** Pass 2 emits state-rendered families in the above order; preserved pass-through lines are interleaved at their original relative positions. When state-rendered directives conflict with existing lines, the state-rendered output wins.

## Executable Step Cards
1. **Scaffolding (Complete)**
   *Purpose:* Establish minimal state model and province location derivation.
   *Preconditions (evidence):* `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapState.scala`, `model/src/main/scala/model/map/ProvinceLocationService.scala`.
   *Actions:* none.
   *Deliverables:* existing files.
   *Verification:* `model/src/test/scala/model/map/MapStateSpec.scala`, `model/src/test/scala/model/map/ProvinceLocationServiceSpec.scala`.
   *Status:* Complete.

2. **Complete `MapDirective` coverage (Pending)**
   *Purpose:* Represent all documented directives and comments.
   *Preconditions (evidence):* `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapDirective.scala` lacks variants for `#pb` and comments.
   *Actions:* add `MapDirective` variants for `#pb` and comment lines; update docs.
   *Deliverables:* `MapDirective.scala`, inventory.
   *Verification:* parser unit tests.
   *Status:* Pending.

3. **Parser emits all `MapDirective` variants and fails on unmapped lines (Pending)**
   *Purpose:* Ensure Pass 1 sees every directive and surfaces defects.
   *Preconditions (evidence):* `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapFileParser.scala` drops unknown lines.
   *Actions:* emit all `MapDirective` variants, capture comments, raise on unmapped lines.
   *Deliverables:* `MapFileParser.scala`, parser tests.
   *Verification:* round-trip tests with malformed input.
   *Status:* Pending.

4. **Pass 1 state builder retains pass-through directives (Pending)**
   *Purpose:* Stream derivation of `MapState` with pass-through preservation.
   *Preconditions (evidence):* `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapState.scala` buffers full stream and loses pass-through directives.
   *Actions:* fold over `MapDirective` stream producing `MapState` and residual pass-through stream.
   *Deliverables:* updated `MapState.scala`.
   *Verification:* unit tests comparing to existing `fromDirectives`.
   *Status:* Pending.

5. **Pass 2 writer merges outputs and pass-through lines (Pending)**
   *Purpose:* Re-emit pass-through directives verbatim and render state-owned directives in order.
   *Preconditions (evidence):* `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapDirectiveCodecs.scala` and `apps/src/main/scala/com/crib/bills/dom6maps/services/mapeditor/MapWriter.scala` only render `MapState`.
   *Actions:* render state-owned directives in canonical order, merge with preserved pass-through stream, append verbatim lines with ordering checks.
   *Deliverables:* `MapDirectiveCodecs.scala`, `MapWriter.scala`.
   *Verification:* golden file round-trip with ordering assertions.
   *Status:* Pending.

6. **Feature-flag integration in loaders and processors (Pending)**
   *Purpose:* Adopt two-pass pipeline without disrupting existing flows.
   *Preconditions (evidence):* `apps/src/main/scala/com/crib/bills/dom6maps/services/mapeditor/MapLayerLoader.scala` and `apps/src/main/scala/com/crib/bills/dom6maps/services/mapeditor/MapProcessingService.scala` load `MapState` directly without feature flag.
   *Actions:* introduce feature flag; switch to two-pass pipeline when enabled.
   *Deliverables:* service implementations, configuration.
   *Verification:* feature flag tests.
   *Status:* Pending.

7. **Refactor map modification services (Pending)**
   *Purpose:* Operate on `MapState` plus directive stream.
   *Preconditions (evidence):* services such as `apps/src/main/scala/com/crib/bills/dom6maps/services/mapeditor/GateDirectiveService.scala` accept only `MapState`.
   *Actions:* update service signatures and adapters.
   *Deliverables:* service files and tests.
   *Verification:* service-level tests.
   *Status:* Pending.

8. **Retire province-id location logic (Pending)**
   *Purpose:* Remove reliance on `ProvincePixels` after new pipeline is proven.
   *Preconditions (evidence):* `model/src/main/scala/model/map/MapDirective.scala` defines `ProvincePixels`.
   *Actions:* drop `ProvincePixels` handling and old lookup paths.
   *Deliverables:* directive models and docs.
   *Verification:* compilation and end-to-end tests under flags.
   *Status:* Pending.

## Two-pass Proof Checklist
- Diff original map with Pass 2 output to confirm ordering and verbatim pass-through.
- Ensure `MapState` from Pass 1 matches `MapState.fromDirectives` for the same input.
- Run end-to-end flow with the feature flag off and on to confirm dual-path behaviour.

## Perf/Memory Acceptance
- Centroid and grid derivation from `#pb` runs must stream the directive stream once and retain only `MapState` in memory.
- Pass 1 and `ProvinceLocationService` will be exercised under constrained heap (`-Xmx64m`) in tests to assert constant-space behaviour.
- Large-map golden tests confirm output equivalence without requiring full-file buffering.
