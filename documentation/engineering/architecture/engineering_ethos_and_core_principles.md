### 1.1 Building Like Mathematicians

The Ouroboros codebase is structured on formal, mathematical foundations. Core functionality is defined using pure abstractions and algebraic data types (ADTs).

#### Key Concepts:

- **Capability Traits**: Service interfaces that define operations in terms of inputs and outputs
- **Type Safety**: Using Scala's type system to model domain concepts with mathematical precision
- **Pure Functions**: Methods don't perform I/O directly but return descriptions of computations
- **Explicit Error Channels**: Error handling is part of the type signature

#### Example: Functional Service Interface

```scala
// From apps/services/feedback/FeedbackService.scala
trait FeedbackService[Sequencer[_]] {
  def submitFeedback[ErrorChannel[_]](
    user: model.user.Id, 
    category: feedback.FeedbackType, 
    contents: feedback.FeedbackContents
  )(using errorChannel: cats.MonadError[ErrorChannel, feedback.Error] & cats.Traverse[ErrorChannel],
        traceId: model.trace.Id
  ): Sequencer[ErrorChannel[status.Ok]]
}
```

### 1.2 Testing Like Scientists

Testing approach treats software as an experiment to be repeatedly run with varying conditions.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Contract-Driven Testing**: Tests written against interfaces (capability traits) rather than implementations
- **Property-Based Testing**: Using ScalaCheck-style generators to test a wide range of inputs
- **Interchangeable Environments**: Same tests run against different implementations (in-memory, database)

#### Example: Property-Based Testing with Interchangeable Implementations

```scala
// From apps/src/test/scala/apps/services/trial/TrialActivationUserFlowServiceTests.scala
test("User flow: create account, activate trial via promo") { services =>
  forall { (email: Email, password: Password, promoText: PromoCodeText) =>
    for {
      // Step 1: Create an account
      creationResponse <- services.createAccount.create(Creation(email, password))
                                 .flatMap(IO.fromEither)
      val createdUser = creationResponse.user
      
      // Step 2: Validate promo code (should be NotFound initially)
      initialStatus <- services.trialActivationService
        .validatePromoCode[Either[PromoCodeError, *]](promoText, createdUser.id)
        .flatMap(IO.fromEither)
        
      // Expect the promo code to be not found before creation
      _ = expect(initialStatus == PromoCodeStatus.NotFound)
      
      // Step 3: Create a promo code and validate again
      _ <- services.promoService.createPromoCode[Either[PromoCodeError, *]](...)
                   .flatMap(IO.fromEither)
    } yield succeed
  }
}
```

### 1.3 Naming Like Novelists

Naming conventions are expressive, precise, and reveal intent, making code readable and self-explanatory.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Clear Role Conventions**: Service contracts use `Service` suffix, implementations use `Impl`, stubs use `Stub`
- **Domain-Driven Names**: Rich vocabulary from the problem domain
- **For-Comprehensions as Narrative**: Code flows like a story with clear steps

#### Example: Clear Naming Conventions

```scala
// From apps/services/document/registration/Service.scala (and related files)
package document.registration

// Interface defining the capability
trait Service[Sequencer[_]] { ... }

// Production implementation
trait Impl[Sequencer[_]] extends Service[Sequencer] { ... }

// Safe stub for testing and scaffolding
trait Stub[Sequencer[_]] extends Service[Sequencer] { ... }
```

### 1.4 Shipping Like Engineers

Engineering practices ensure code runs reliably in production and can be continuously delivered.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Stubs for Incremental Development**: Safe implementations of service interfaces for unfinished features
- **Resilient Integration**: Modular design with replaceable parts
- **Continuous Deployment Readiness**: Infrastructure for containerization and deployment
